        <h1>Web Accessibility<br />& Why You Should Care</h1>
        <p>By Melvin Chen</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Web accessibility refers to ensuring that users can access and use the services provided by a website,
            regardless of disability. In other words, it is a set of guidelines that websites must follow to make
            sure everyone can use their site.</p>
        <p>The web accessibility guidlines account for those that are visually impaired (those that use screen
            readers or color deficiencies), those that are hearing impaired (cannot access audio or video content), and
            those without fine motor coordination.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why should I do it?</h2>
        <p>Besides being inconsiderate to all audiences, disregarding web accessibility has legal repercussions.
            Violating Americans with Disability Act requirements can cost companies thousands to millions of dollars
            worth of
            lawsuits. In 2008, Target was sued by the National Federation of the Blind with over $6 million worth of
            class damages and plaintiff legal fees over $3 million.</p>
        <p>In addition to its legality, having web accessible content drives more users or readers to websites. To put
            its issue into perspective, businesses can lose up to 4.5% (approximate percent of population that is
            colorblind) of their potential web traffic just by not accounting for color blindness. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Things to consider:</h2>
        <p>There are more standards than the three on this list, but hitting these requirements is large step in the
            right direction. These are also requirements that can be noticed without knowing how to code</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="img/color_contrast.svg" class="dividing_img" />
        <h3>Color contrast:</h3>
        <p>Many times, web designers and users without disabilities forget that not everyone sees colors the same way.
            Thus, just differentiating certain objects in web pages with colors can be extremely difficult for certain
            users.</p>
        <p>A better solution involves designing with non-color differentiators. For example, in forms with requirements,
            a web designer could differentiate required fields with an asterisk instead of just color.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color.png">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color_sim.png">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Red-Blind (Protanopia)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
                <img src="img/color_field/link_color_better.png">
                <img src="img/color_field/link_color_better_sim.png">
                    <p>The asterisk helps to differentiate required text fields from those that are not required</p>
            </div>


        <p>Confirmation and cancellation buttons are also important as they are often only differentiated with red and
            green.</p>
        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_bad.png">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_bad_sim.png">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Red-Blind (Protanopia)</p>
        </div>
        <p>A web designer could make one button a solid
            color and the other an outline to make one more
            prominent than the other.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_better.png">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_better_sim.png">
        </div>

        <p>The designer could take it a step further and add an icon that really
            differentiate the two.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_best.png">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_best_sim.png">
        </div>
        <p>Coloring also affects links. For example:</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_link/link_both.png">
            <img src="img/color_link/link_both_sim.png">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Blue-Blind (Tritanopia)</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="img/link.svg" class="dividing_img" style="width: 60px" />
        <h3>Descriptive links:</h3>
        <p>Everyone has seen a link that has said “Click here”. These links usually come after normal text and work
            decently well for those with normal vision. However, screen readers users often skip from link to link
            and
            only have the text to read off of. This results in screen readers just reading “Click here” or “More
            information” without the links context.</p>
        <p>A better solution would be writing a short description that provides context for the link.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>

                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms">click here</a></p>
