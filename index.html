        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Web accessibility refers to ensuring that users can access and use the services provided by a website,
            regardless of disability. In other words, <b class="highlight">it is a set of guidelines that websites must
                follow to make
                sure everyone can use their site</b>.</p>
        <p>The web accessibility guidlines account for those that are visually impaired (those that use screen
            readers or color deficiencies), those that are hearing impaired (cannot access audio or video content), and
            those without fine motor coordination.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why should I do it?</h2>
        <p>Besides being inconsiderate to all audiences, <b class="highlight">disregarding web accessibility has legal
                repercussions</b>.
            Violating Americans with Disability Act requirements can cost companies thousands to millions of dollars
            worth of
            lawsuits. In 2008, Target was sued by the National Federation of the Blind with over $6 million worth of
            class damages and plaintiff legal fees over $3 million.</p>
        <p>In addition to its legality, <b class="highlight">having web accessible content drives more users or readers
                to websites</b>. To put
            its issue into perspective, businesses can lose up to 4.5% (approximate percent of population that is
            colorblind) of their potential web traffic just by not accounting for color blindness. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Things to consider:</h2>
        <p>There are more standards than the three on this list, but hitting these requirements is large step in the
            right direction. These are also requirements that can be noticed without knowing how to code</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="img/color_contrast.svg" class="dividing_img" />
        <h3>Color contrast:</h3>
        <p>Many times, web designers and users without disabilities forget that not everyone sees colors the same way.
            Thus, <b class="highlight">just differentiating certain objects in web pages with colors can be extremely
                difficult for certain
                users</b>.</p>
        <p>A better solution involves designing with non-color differentiators. For example, in forms with requirements,
            a web designer could differentiate required fields with an asterisk instead of just color.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color.png">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color_sim.png">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Red-Blind (Protanopia)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color_better.png">
            <img src="img/color_field/link_color_better_sim.png">
            <p>The asterisk helps to differentiate required text fields from those that are not required</p>
        </div>


        <p>Confirmation and cancellation buttons are also important as they are often only differentiated with red and
            green.</p>
        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_bad.png" alt="example of an inaccessible button">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_bad_sim.png"
                alt="example of an inaccessible button under color-blindness simulation">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Red-Blind (Protanopia)</p>
        </div>
        <p>A web designer could make one button a solid
            color and the other an outline to make one more
            prominent than the other.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_better.png" alt="example of an accessible button">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_better_sim.png"
                alt="example of an accessible button under color-blindness simulation">
        </div>

        <p>The designer could take it a step further and add an icon that really
            differentiate the two.</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_best.png" alt="example of an even more accessible button">
            <img src="img/color_button/color_button_best_sim.png"
                alt="good example of an even more accessible button under color-blindness simulation">
        </div>
        <p>Coloring also affects links. With Blue-Blind colorblindness, links that are not underlined can be hard to
            differentiate. Take a look at these examples:</p>

        <div class="section_example--two-split">
            <img src="img/color_link/link_both.png">
            <img src="img/color_link/link_both_sim.png">
            <p>Left: seeing these buttons with normal vision <br />
                Right: seeing these buttons with Blue-Blind (Tritanopia)</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="img/link.svg" class="dividing_img" style="width: 60px" />
        <h3>Descriptive links:</h3>
        <p>Everyone has seen a link that has said “Click here”. These links usually come after normal text and work
            decently well for those with normal vision. However, <b class="highlight">screen readers (tools that read web content to those
            with low or no vision) often skip from link to link
            and only have the text to read off of</b>. This results in screen readers just reading “Click here” or “More
            information” without the links context.</p>
        <p>A better solution would be writing a short description that provides context for the link.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p><strong style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">Bad: </strong>To read more about WCAG link description
            guidelines, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms">click here</a></p>
        <p><strong style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">Better: </strong>Read more about <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms">WCAG link description
                guidelines</a>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="img/img.svg" class="dividing_img" style="width: 70px" />
        <h3>Image Labels</h3>
        <p>This accessibility guideline is mostly invisible to the majority of the population but is important
            nonetheless. <b class="highlight">This criterion is met when there is a descriptive label provided for each image in a webpage</b>.
            In the page’s code structure, there is a field on images for the “alt text” or alternative text. This field is similar to a caption for the image. Screen
            reader users use this alternative text to understand the message conveyed by the images. <b class="highlight">Websites are not required to provide alternative texts for images that are purely decorative.</b></p>
        <p>Take a look at how an image is placed on a website</p>
        <div class="section_example--one-split">
            <img src="img/img_alt/img_alt.png" />
            <p>The alt text is telling screen readers that this image is "an example of an accessible button under
                color-blindness simulation"</p>
        </div>
        <p>Having these alternative texts help users with low or no vision to understand what is being presented and
            keeps with the flow of the page. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Wrap up</h2>
        <p>Web accessibility is an unseen issue to most of the population, but those that need it can really suffer from
            its absence. Designing web pages with accessibility in mind will often also improve the experience for users
            with normal vision as well. <b class="highlight">Providing a means for all users to access a site is not only good for business,
            it provides a legal safeguard from potential lawsuits</b>. While, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution for
            being fully web-accessible, meeting the basic requirements is definitely a step in the right direction.</p>
